<title>About C3R</title>
</head>
<body>
This <b>C3R prototype</b> was developed to illustrate the feasability of our model for conformity checking in construction.
<p>The C3R prototype (which stands for <b>C</b>onformity <b>C</b>hecking in <b>C</b>onstruction with <b>R</b>easoning) automates the process of reasoning whether a construction project is or is not conform to an organised base of conformity queries. 
<p>The main components of the C3R prototype correspond to the main components of our conformity-checking model.
